The objectives of the project include creating an open-source ASR system with a Word Error Rate of less than 0.15, supporting long-form audio transcription, and benchmarking various ASR models. The paper also mentions the development of an open-source subtitling platform for Indic languages and the submission of a paper for NLDB 2024.
