        "# **Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) across a wide range of applications and research topics. Immediate engineering skills help in better understanding the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs). Researchers use prompt engineering to improve LLMs' ability to perform various common and complex tasks, such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompt techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "This guide covers the fundamentals of prompts to give you a rough idea of how to use them to interact with and instruct large language models (LLMs).\n",
        "\n",
        "All examples are tested with `text-davinci-003` (using OpenAI's playground) unless otherwise specified. It uses default settings, i.e., `temperature=0.7` and `top-p=1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **LLM Settings**\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with prompts, you will be interacting with the LLM directly or through an API. You can configure some parameters to get different results for your prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Temperature** - In short, the lower the `temperature`, the more deterministic the results are, meaning that the highest probable next token is always chosen. Increasing the temperature can lead to more randomness, encouraging more diverse or creative outputs. Essentially, we are increasing the weights of other possible tokens. In terms of application, we may want to use a lower temperature value for tasks such as fact-based quality control, encouraging more factual and concise responses. For poem generation or other creative tasks, it may be beneficial to increase the temperature value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Top_p** - Similarly, with `top_p`, a sampling technique with temperature called nucleus sampling, you can control the model's degree of determinism in generating a response. If you are looking for precise and factual answers, keep this low. If you are looking for more diverse answers, increase it to a higher value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general recommendation is to change one, not both.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before starting with some basic examples, remember that your results may vary depending on the LLM version you are using.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Prompt Basics**\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Basic Prompts**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can achieve a lot with simple prompts, but the quality of the results depends on the amount of information you provide and how well-crafted they are. A prompt can contain information such as an *instruction* or *question* you are passing to the model and include other details such as *context*, *inputs*, or *examples*. You can use these elements to better instruct the model and, as a result, get better results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's start by analyzing a basic example of a simple prompt:\n",
        "\n",
        "*Prompt:*\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "The sky is\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "*Output:*\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "blueThe sky is blue on a clear day. On a cloudy day, the sky can be gray or white.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "As you can see, the language model generates a string continuation that makes sense in the context of `\"The sky is\"`. The output can be unexpected or far from the task we want to accomplish.\n",
        "\n",
        "This basic example also highlights the need to provide more context or instructions on what specifically we want to achieve.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's try to improve it a bit:\n",
        "\n",
        "*Prompt:*\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Complete the sentence: The sky is\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "*Output:*\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "so beautiful.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Is this better? Well, we told the model to complete the sentence, so the result is much better as it follows exactly what we said to do (\"complete the sentence\"). This approach of designing ideal prompts to instruct the model to perform a task is called **prompt engineering**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The example above is a basic illustration of what is possible with LLMs today. Today's LLMs are capable of performing all kinds of advanced tasks, ranging from text summarization to mathematical reasoning and code generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Prompt Formatting**\n",
        "\n",
        "We tried a very simple prompt above. A standard prompt has the following format:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "<Question>?\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "or\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "<Instruction>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This can be formatted into a question-answer (QA) format, which is standard in many QA datasets, as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Q: <Question>?A:\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "When asking like the above, also known as *zero-shot prompting*, you are asking the model for a response directly without any example or demonstration about the task you want to perform. Some large language models can perform zero-shot prompts, but this depends on the complexity and knowledge of the task at hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the standard format above, a popular and effective technique for prompting is called *few-shot prompting*, where we provide examples (i.e., demonstrations). Few-shot prompts can be formatted as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "<Question>?<Answer><Question>?<Answer><Question>?<Answer><Question>?\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The QA format version would look like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Q: <Question>?A: <Answer>Q: <Question>?A: <Answer>Q: <Question>?A: <Answer>Q: <Question>?A:\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that using the QA format is unnecessary. The prompt format depends on the task at hand. For example, you may perform a simple classification task and provide examples that demonstrate the task as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "*Prompt:*\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "This is awesome! // PositiveThis is bad! // NegativeWow, that movie was rad! // PositiveWhat a horrible show! //\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "*Output:*\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Negative\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Few-shot prompts allow for in-context learning, which is the ability of language models to learn tasks given some demonstrations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Prompt Elements**\n",
        "\n",
        "As we cover more and more examples and possible applications with prompt engineering, you'll notice that certain elements make up a prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "A prompt may contain any of the following components:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Instruction** - a specific task or instruction you want the model to perform\n",
        "\n",
        "**Context** - may involve external information or additional context that can guide the model to better answers\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input data** - is the input or question for which we are interested in finding an answer\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output indicator** - indicates the type or format of the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Not all components are necessary for a prompt, and the format depends on the task at hand. We will cover more concrete examples in the next guides.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **General Tips for Designing Prompts**\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some tips to keep in mind when designing your prompts:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Start Simple**\n",
        "\n",
        "When you start creating prompts, remember that it is an iterative process that requires a lot of experimentation to get the best results. Using a simple playground like OpenAI or Cohere's is a good starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can start with simple prompts and keep adding more elements and context as you seek better results. Version control of your prompt along the way is vital for this reason. As you read the guide, you'll see many examples where specificity, simplicity, and conciseness often yield better results.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you have a large task involving many different subtasks, try breaking the task into simpler subtasks and keep increasing as you get better results. This avoids adding too much complexity to the prompt design process at the start.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Instruction**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can create effective prompts for various simple tasks using commands to instruct the model on what you want to achieve, such as \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" \"Summarize,\" \"Translate,\" \"Sort,\" etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep in mind that you also need to experiment a lot to see what works best. Try different instructions with different keywords, contexts, and data, and see what works best for your specific use case and task. Usually, the more specific and relevant the context is to the task you are trying to perform, the better. We will cover the importance of sampling and adding more context in the upcoming guides.\n",
        "\n",
        "Others recommend that the instructions be placed at the beginning of the prompt. It is also recommended that some clear separator, such as \"###,\" be used to separate the instruction and the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "*Prompt:*\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "### Instruction ###Translate the text below into Spanish:Text: \"hello!\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "*Output:*\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "¡Hola!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Specificity**\n",
        "\n",
        "Be very specific about the instruction and task you want the model to perform. The more descriptive and detailed the prompt, the better the results. This is particularly important when you have a desired outcome or generation style you are looking for. There are no specific tokens or keywords that lead to better results. It is more important to have a good format and a descriptive prompt. Providing examples in the prompt is very effective in obtaining the desired output in specific formats.\n",
        "\n",
        "When creating prompts, you should also keep in mind the prompt's size, as there are limitations on how large it can be. Thinking about how specific and detailed you should be is something to consider. Including too many unnecessary details is not necessarily a good approach. The details should be relevant and contribute to the task at hand. This is something you will need to experiment with a lot. We encourage a lot of experimentation and iteration to optimize your application prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an example, let's try a simple prompt to extract specific information from a text.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Prompt:*\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Extract the name of places in the following text.Desired format:Place: <list_of_company_names_separated_by_commas>Input: \"While these developments are encouraging for researchers, much remains a mystery. “We often have a black box between the brain and the effect we see on the periphery,” says Henrique Veiga-Fernandes, a neuroimmunologist at the Champalimaud Center for the Unknown in Lisbon. “If we want to use it in a therapeutic context, we really need to understand the mechanism.\"\n",

        "Use 2 to 3 sentences to explain the concept of prompt engineering to a high school student.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Dos and Don'ts**\n",
        "\n",
        "Another common tip when creating prompts is to avoid telling the model what not to do but instead tell it what to do. This encourages more specificity and focuses on the details that lead to good responses from the model.\n",

        "While CoT prompting is a powerful technique, it is not without its challenges. One of the main considerations is that the model’s reasoning process might still be influenced by biases in the training data or the limitations of the model itself. For example, in ethical dilemmas, the model’s reasoning might reflect certain cultural or philosophical biases inherent in the data it was trained on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, while CoT prompting can improve performance on reasoning tasks, it can also make prompts more complex and potentially harder for users to craft. This complexity underscores the importance of iteration and experimentation in prompt engineering to find the optimal balance between guiding the model effectively and maintaining simplicity.\n",
